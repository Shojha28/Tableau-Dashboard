# HR Analytics Dashboard â€“ Employee Attrition Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing employee attrition trends using HR data visualization techniques. I developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to identify key factors driving workforce attrition, measure job satisfaction, and provide insights into workforce demographics. The analysis helps HR teams in strategic decision-making, retention planning, and improving employee engagement.

## Key Responsibilities & Actions Taken
âœ” Cleaned and preprocessed HR data for visualization and trend analysis.

âœ” Built an interactive dashboard displaying attrition trends by department, gender, education, and age groups.

âœ” Analyzed job satisfaction ratings and their correlation with attrition.

âœ” Identified workforce demographics influencing attrition rates.

## KPIs Used
â€¢	Attrition Rate = (Employees Left / Total Employees) * 100

â€¢	Employee Count & Active Employees

â€¢	Department-wise & Gender-based Attrition

â€¢	Job Satisfaction Score

â€¢	Education Field-wise Attrition

â€¢	Age-based Employee Distribution


## Key Insights & Findings

ðŸ“Œ High Attrition in R&D (56%) & Sales Departments â€“ These roles may have higher stress levels or better external opportunities.

ðŸ“Œ Employees aged 25-34 show the highest attrition (18.14%) â€“ Likely due to career progression shifts or external job market demand.

ðŸ“Œ Job Satisfaction Impact â€“ Employees in Sales & Research roles report higher satisfaction, while HR & Manufacturing roles have lower scores.

ðŸ“Œ Education-based Attrition â€“ Life Sciences & Medical professionals show higher turnover, possibly due to high industry demand.

ðŸ“Œ Male attrition is higher (150 vs 87 female employees) â€“ This may indicate career mobility trends or job preferences.
