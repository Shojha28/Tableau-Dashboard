## Introduction
Employee attrition is a major challenge for organizations, affecting productivity, morale, and hiring costs. In this project, I analyzed HR attrition data and built an interactive Tableau dashboard to uncover key trends, identify high-risk job roles, and provide actionable insights for improving employee retention.

## Project Overview
Project Overview
The objective of this project was to visualize and analyze employee attrition trends across different departments, job roles, and demographics. The Tableau dashboard provides a real-time overview of key HR metrics such as:
•	Attrition rate by department, education, and job role.

•	Job satisfaction levels and their correlation with attrition.

•	Age and gender-based attrition trends.

By using Tableau for data visualization, I transformed raw HR data into a dynamic, interactive dashboard that allows HR teams to drill down into key insights and take data-driven actions.


## The key questions I aimed to answer were:
•	What is the overall attrition rate, and how does it vary by department and job role?

•	Which age groups and educational backgrounds are more prone to attrition?

•	How does job satisfaction impact attrition?

•	By leveraging data visualization techniques, I transformed raw data into actionable insights, enabling HR teams to improve employee retention strategies.


## Step 1: Data Import and Cleaning
The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed in Excel to remove inconsistencies and ensure data accuracy. Key cleaning steps included:

•	Removing duplicates to maintain data integrity.

•	Handling missing values in employee records.

•	Standardizing department and job role classifications for uniformity.

Once cleaned, the data was imported into Tableau for interactive visualization.

## Step 2: Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Used
To measure and analyze workforce trends, I focused on the following KPIs:

•	Total Employees: The overall workforce size.

•	Attrition Count: The number of employees leaving the company.

•	Attrition Rate: The percentage of employees leaving, calculated as:
    Attrition Rate=(Attrition Count/Total Employees) ×100

•	Job Satisfaction Rating: Employee ratings on workplace satisfaction.

•	Department-wise Attrition: Attrition distribution across HR, Sales, and R&D.

•	Education Field-wise Attrition: The impact of different education backgrounds on attrition.

•	Attrition by Gender and Age Group: Breakdown of attrition patterns based on gender and age.


## Step 3: Data Analysis & Key Findings
Using Tableau visualizations, I analyzed attrition trends and identified critical insights:

•	Sales and R&D departments experience the highest attrition rates, indicating job pressure and market competitiveness.

•	Employees aged 25-34 have the highest attrition rate, suggesting mid-career employees seek better opportunities elsewhere.

•	Job satisfaction significantly influences retention, with lower satisfaction scores correlating to higher attrition.

•	Employees with technical degrees exhibit lower attrition, while marketing and business graduates are more likely to leave.

•	Male employees show slightly higher attrition rates than females, suggesting work-life balance factors may be at play

## Step 4: Tableau Dashboard Development
I designed an interactive Tableau dashboard to visually represent attrition trends using:
•	KPI Cards: Displaying total employees, attrition rate, and active employees.

•	Pie Charts: Illustrating department-wise and education-wise attrition.

•	Bar Graphs: Comparing job satisfaction levels across roles.

•	Histograms & Line Graphs: Showcasing age-based attrition trends.

•	Filters & Interactive Tooltips: Allowing users to drill down into specific demographics for deeper analysis.

The dashboard enables HR teams to quickly identify workforce trends and make data-driven retention decisions.


## Step 5: Key Insights and Recommendations

**Main Causes of Attrition:**
•	Low job satisfaction in high-stress roles (e.g., Sales & R&D).

•	Lack of career growth for mid-career employees (ages 25-34).
•	Work-life balance concerns, especially among male employees.
•	Higher attrition among employees with non-technical backgrounds.

## Recommendations for HR Teams:
1.	Improve Employee Engagement: Conduct regular job satisfaction surveys and act on feedback.
2.	Career Development Programs: Offer mentorship and upskilling opportunities to retain mid-career employees.
3.	Flexible Work Policies: Implement hybrid work models to improve work-life balance.
4.	Retention Strategies for High-Risk Roles: Provide competitive salaries and better career growth for employees in Sales & R&D.
